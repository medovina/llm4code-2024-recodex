1. The code needs to be properly divided into functions (structures, logical blocks, ...).
2. Important constant values (pin numbers, animation periods, ...) should be declared as constants (not directly embedded as literals in code).
3. Do not repeat (copy-paste) your code. Use functions, for-loops, ...
4. Only valid utilization of global variables is allowed. They must not replace local variables or take the role of function arguments.
5. Logical parts of the application must be grouped together (e.g., using structures). Communication between parts must be conducted solely through a well-defined interface (functions/methods).
